        <p>Hi, my name is Mariana. I am a postbac researcher in the <a href="https://www.ess.uci.edu/" title="https://www.ess.uci.edu/">Earth System Science Department</a> at UC Irvine.</p>
        <p>I study <a href="https://marine.copernicus.eu/explainers/phenomena-threats/heatwaves" title="https://marine.copernicus.eu/explainers/phenomena-threats/heatwaves"> marine heatwaves</a>, their drivers and ways to track them.<br>
        Furthermore, I am interested in pursuing an advanced degree and study biophysical interactions. This topic provides an exciting opportunity to answer questions about how climate and climate change influence marine biogeochemistry and ecosystems.</p>
        <p>I am also actively contributing to levaraging community-engaged research as an NSF funded <a href="https://specialreports.news.uci.edu/climate-change/education-and-outreach/nsf-funding-environmental-justice-initiative.php" title="https://specialreports.news.uci.edu/climate-change/education-and-outreach/nsf-funding-environmental-justice-initiative.php">CLIMATE Justice </a> fellow with the <a href="https://crystalcove.org/education/" title="https://crystalcove.org/education/">Crystal Cove Conservancy</a>.</p>
        <p>At UCI, I am part of the working group on <a href="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/drakelab/people/" title="https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/drakelab/people/">Ocean and Climate Dynamics</a> led by Dr. Henri F. Drake.</p>
